# ImageHint

A browser extension to help intermediate language learners read texts in
their target language.  Highlight a word or phrase that you're unfamiliar with
and right-click to view image search results (thus maintaining some level
of immersion, unlike tools that provide a translation in your native language).

Obviously the results aren't always useful (especially when a word is
also the name of a major piece of media, similar to a common word in
a more widely-spoken language, or difficult to represent pictorally), but
it works decently a lot of the time.
